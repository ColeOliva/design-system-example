Implementing a design system

# Instructions

Review the image depicting the design system on Canvas (also in the repository) and then implement it by changing `index.html` and `designsystem.css`. There is some scaffolding in these files to assist you but you will likely need to make many changes to reflect the design system. Don't worry about replicating the layout in the image.

Happy coding!
